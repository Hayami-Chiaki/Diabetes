## Project Overview

This project aims to classify and predict diabetes outcomes using the XGBoost model. The data is sourced from a CSV file containing multiple features and a target variable. The project process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation. Through this project, you can learn how to use XGBoost for multiclass classification tasks and assess model performance.

## Environment Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

Ensure that you have installed these libraries. If not, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Dataset

The dataset is located at `C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\Python Experiments\data.csv`. It contains the following features:

- `HighBP`: High Blood Pressure
- `HighChol`: High Cholesterol
- `CholCheck`: Cholesterol Check
- `BMI`: Body Mass Index
- `Smoker`: Smoking Status
- `Stroke`: Stroke History
- `HeartDiseaseorAttack`: Heart Disease or Attack History
- `PhysActivity`: Physical Activity
- `Fruits`: Fruit Consumption
- `HvyAlcoholConsump`: Heavy Alcohol Consumption
- `AnyHealthcare`: Any Healthcare Received
- `NoDocbcCost`: Doctor Consultation without Cost
- `GenHlth`: General Health
- `MentHlth`: Mental Health
- `PhysHlth`: Physical Health
- `DiffWalk`: Difficulty in Walking
- `Sex`: Gender
- `Age`: Age
- `Education`: Education Level
- `Income`: Income

The target variable is `target`, representing the classification outcome.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**: Read the CSV file using pandas.
2. **Dataset Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Standardize the features using StandardScaler.
4. **Model Configuration**: Set up the parameters for the XGBoost model, including learning rate, maximum depth, objective function, evaluation metric, and number of classes.
5. **Data Conversion**: Convert the training and testing sets into DMatrix format for XGBoost.
6. **Model Training**: Train the XGBoost model with early stopping criteria.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Predict using the test set and calculate the F1 score and accuracy.

## Code Explanation

- `diabetes = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\Python Experiments\data.csv')`: Reads the dataset.
- `train_test_split`: Splits the dataset.
- `StandardScaler`: Standardizes the features.
- `xgb.DMatrix`: Converts data into DMatrix format.
- `xgb.train`: Trains the XGBoost model.
- `model.predict`: Makes predictions.
- `f1_score` and `accuracy_score`: Evaluate model performance.

## Results Output

The code will output the predictions, F1 score, and accuracy. The F1 score is calculated using the macro average, which is suitable for multiclass classification tasks.

## Notes

- Ensure the dataset path is correct.
- Feature and target variable names should match those in the code.
- Check data format and library versions if any errors or warnings occur.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different XGBoost parameters to optimize model performance.
- Use cross-validation to further assess model stability.
- Try other machine learning algorithms for comparison.
